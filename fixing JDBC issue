I was having trouble accessing postgres from the notebook in DSX, here is the solution. 

Just add the driver to a folder called ~/data/libs
 
!wget https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-9.4.1207.jre7.jar -nc
 
!cp postgresql-9.4.1207.jre7.jar ~/data/libs
 
and then restart the kernel ( there's a drop down menu called Kernel, just choose "restart") and then you will be able to use postrgres jdbc tools
 
df = sqlContext.read.format('jdbc').options(url='jdbc:postgresql://bluemix-sandbox-dal-9-portal.2.dblayer.com:15656/compose', \
                                            dbtable='game', \
                                            user='admin', \
                                            password='RFSUPYGYXCMNKGUN'
                                           ).load()
 
Let me know if you have any issues. Thanks.
